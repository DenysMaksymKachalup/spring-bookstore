The Online Book Store Project is an e-commerce platform designed to provide users with a convenient and enjoyable way to discover, purchase, and manage their favorite books online. The project was created with the aim of bridging the gap between book enthusiasts and their desired reads, offering a seamless shopping experience from the comfort of their own home.
## Project Structureüë®‚Äçüíª

The Project Structure embodies best practices, including adherence to SOLID principles, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. Technology like Spring Framework empower robust backend development, while Docker facilitates streamlined deployment across diverse environments. MapStruct simplifies object mapping tasks, promoting code clarity and maintainability. Additionally, Liquibase enables efficient database versioning, enhancing data integrity and management. This structured approach fosters a scalable and adaptable project architecture, poised for seamless growth and evolution.
